# The Open Anarchist License

A libre open source license for any peaceful individual.

The knowledge shared under this license is freely available to any one who does not initiate aggressive violence against another peaceful individual. Those that do not harm others have the explicit permission to do with this knowledge as they please, including _use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software_. This license explicitly encourages productive entrepreneurs to build products and services based on the presented ideas and code.

However, this license explicitly prohibits any individual or entity who is engaging in, or encouraging _murder, assault, coercion, theft, rape, trespassing, lying_. This includes, but is not limited to any state government, police agency, monopolist, mafia or gang of thieves. Any act that is taking a scarce good from another individual without the explicit consent and voluntary interaction is considered wrong and constitutes a break of the license agreements.
